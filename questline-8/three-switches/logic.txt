 Strategy

1. Turn ON Switch 1 and leave it on for a few minutes.  
     This will heat up the bulb.

2. After a few minutes, turn OFF Switch 1.  

3. Turn ON Switch 2 and leave it on.  

4. Leave Switch 3 OFF and untouched.  

5. Now enter the room:
     If the bulb is ON, it is controlled by Switch 2.  
     If the bulb is OFF but warm, it is controlled by Switch 1.  
     If the bulb is OFF and cold, it is controlled by Switch 3.
     
logic 

The heat of the bulb helps too detect whether it was  turned on Switch 1.  
The light shows if its currently on Switch 2.  
If its neither warm nor on, the third switch must be the correct one Switch 3.
