# String Reversal in Python
# Iterative Method
We reverse the string by looping from the last character to the first and building the reversed string step by step.
Steps
1. Start with an empty string.
2. Loop through the input string backwards.
3. Append each character to the result string.
4. The result will be the reversed string.

# Recursive Method
We reverse the string by recursion.

Steps:
1.  If the string length is 0 or 1, return the string as it is.
2. Recursive step: Take the last character + call the function again with the rest of the string.
3. This process continues until the step 1 is reached.
